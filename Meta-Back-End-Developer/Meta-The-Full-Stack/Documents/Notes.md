## What is 'Stack' in Full Stack Development?

* They are a set of applications or technologies you use to fix a problem or create a project with a certain development focus. 
* Some Examples of stacks are:
    * __Front-End Stack__: Comprises of languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript. They are used together the front-end or the user interface part of a web application.
    * __Back-End Stack__: Comprises of languages such as python, frameworks such as Django and tools such as DRF.
    * __Data Stack__: A part of the back end stack, which consists of database management systems and database applications to process data.
* There are various types of stacks which comprise of different technologies/tools such as the MERN stack, LAMP stack, LEMP stack, etc.

## Back-End Stack:

* Has all the tools and technologies to create an applications core, which includes business logic, workflows and data. 
* Backend development uses languages such as Python or JavaScript, frameworks such as Django and utilities such as DRF.
* The back-end stack also builds tools, databases and caching applications.

## Front-End Stack:

* The front-End Stack has two distinct parts:
    * Web
    * Mobile
* Includes everything one would need to create a user interface of a web or mobile application that communicates with the backend. 

### Web Front-End Stack:

* To build the front end component, one should konw HTML, CSS, CSS frameworks.
* They should also figure out client side programming languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript and JS frameworks such as React.

### Mobile Front-End Stack:

* Either Android or iOS Development.

## Data Stack

* One of the most important part of any web application is the data stack or, the tools one uses to store, retrieve and process data.
* Contains SQL or NoSQL database engines, caching tools and everything required to process data. 
* MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL are the most widely used database tools for the data stack. These would come under SQL database engines. 
* Some examples of NoSQL database engines are MongoDB and Firebase.
* For caching, Redis is a popular and a widely used solution.

## Full Stack

* It contains everything that allows one to:
    * Prepare the application's back-end
    * Process, retrieve and store data
    * Present that data via APIs
    * On web/mobile applications.
* A full stack developer is equally skilled in all of the different stacks. 
* Such a developer should also know some basic DevOps skills in order to deploy their web-app to Production, Staging and Development Servers.
* Should also be familiar with a version control solution, e.g. Git.

## Full Stack Developer's Responsibilities:

* A Full stack developer performs:
    * Understand the complete project and take full ownership
    * Select appropriate tools for developing the front-end back-end and database
    * Create effective user interfaces for the web or mobile environments
    * Develop APIs
    * Develop the back-end of applications
    * Store, process, retrieve data from databases
    * Create servers and manage them for development, staging and production access
    * Integrate with CI/CD workflows
    * Ensure responsiveness of applications
    * Work together with the graphics team to bring their ideas to life
    * Optimize the applications for maximum performance
    * Ensure that their application follows the best security practices
