# Introduction

Use these as your guiding principles to prepare for and ace interviews:

## Best Practices for Job Interviews

* Be Authentic: 
    * Have to be strategic about what I am going to emphasize and how to present things
    * Do not reveal everything
    * Don't lie, interviewers are good at snuffing out dishonesty
        * Interviewers are more likely to connect with you if they see you as an authentic human being
* Sell yourself
    * _Tip: Practice self-promotion, not doing so can make things awkward during an interview._
    * Prepare authentic answers that highlight your greatest strengths and accomplishments. A big part of this is to tell good, interesting and relevant stories about your experiences.
* Be concise
    * Don't ramble or get off-topic
    * __Rule__: Do not go longer than 2 minutes on any single answer, unless you are asked follow up questions.
    * Preparation is the key to answering questions in a concise manner
* Show enthusiasm
    * Show interest about the job

## Most common mistakes during an interview

* Lack of professionalism
    * Includes mistakes like arriving late
    * Professionalism also covers things like how you dress, present yourself, and whether or not you follow interview etiquette(like sending thank you notes)
* Lack of preparation
    * This is the one that sabotages a great number of candidates.
    * Good Preparation includes:
        * Analyzing the job description
        * Researching the firm
        * Thinking through your answers to key questions
        * Behavioral stories
        * Most importantly, __practicing__.
* Lack of content, might be because:
    * In other words, your answers are lame, usually because you haven't prepared
    * Answers are general: _I am a team player, I am a people person_.
* Negativity
    * Never trash talk anyone from your current or previous job

# Behavioral Interviews

* Contain questions such as:
    * Tell me about a time when...
    * Give me an example...
* These questions are opportunities to sell yourself
* Don't just wing them
